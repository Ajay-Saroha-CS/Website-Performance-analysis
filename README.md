🔍 Website Performance Analysis Using Python & Pandas

I recently completed a data analysis project focused on understanding user behavior and engagement across various marketing channels. Using Python, pandas, seaborn, and Matplotlib, I explored over 3,000 rows of traffic and engagement data.

🚀 Key Insights:

📈 Organic Social was the top traffic source, delivering the highest number of users and sessions.

🎥 Organic Video had the highest average engagement time (250+ sec), showing strong content effectiveness.

⏰ Peak activity happened around midnight and evenings (6–10 PM) — ideal timing for content releases.

📉 Email and Organic Video showed zero traffic or engagement, indicating inactive or ineffective campaigns.

🤝 Engaged sessions were highest in Referral, Organic Social, and Organic Search, reflecting strong user interest.

📊 Engagement rate varied greatly by channel — with Referral and Search performing well, and Unassigned and Email needing attention.

📉 No strong correlation found between high traffic and engagement rate (correlation = 0.08), meaning more users ≠ more engagement.
